# To-do list

- [ ] Implement the rest of the code standard rules
- [ ] Additional output formats:
    - [x] Machine-parseable format (for editors to integrate with)
      - [ ] Figure out a good way to preserve labels/supplementary messages
      - [ ] Come up with a Vim `'errorformat'` string to match the output format
    - [ ] JSON
    - [ ] Output source code annotated with errors in-line
- [ ] Overhaul documentation
- [ ] Figure out and possibly provide configurations for editor integration
  - [ ] Vim
  - [ ] Neovim
  - [ ] VS Code (probably too difficult to be worth it)
- [ ] LSP support? (Probably a massive undertaking)
